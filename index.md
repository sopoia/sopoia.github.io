## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6, part 2
  I liked this lab since it was our first time creating and using a command line array to analyze the code's inputs when run. Making the functions seemed easy in theory, but when applying it, it was easy to create bugs in the code if they were not checked multiple times. It showed how much easier it is to finish code after the functions are complete and running smoothly.


* Lab 8, part 1
I liked this lab because we used both arrays and for loops, which I enjoy doing. Also, using member functions was interesting since there’s a variety I didn’t know about, and it showed me how much is already incorporated into C++. It was a simple lab to understand and had good organization.


* Lab 11, part 2

  I liked this lab because we had to finish the code for a game. Using the objects from the different classes was a new and fun experience since it simplified the code and made it easier to understand. It helps give a perspective on how you can organize your code and not have it overwhelm you.
